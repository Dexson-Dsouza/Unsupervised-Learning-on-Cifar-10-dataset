# Unsupervised-Learning-on-Cifar-10-dataset
This project consists of 2 parts.
For part 1, we will perform K-means clustering on Cifar 10 dataset. We will also perform qualify analysis of our
result using Average Silhouette Coefficient and Dunnâ€™s Index evaluation metrics.
For part 2, we will use Auto-Encoder on the dataset. Using Auto-encoder, we will generate a sparse representation
of the dataset. We perform K-means clustering on the encoded data. We will use Average Silhouette Coefficient to
assess the quality of the clusters.
